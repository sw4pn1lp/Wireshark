## Wireshark
- Wireshark is the world’s foremost and widely-used network protocol analyzer. 
- It lets you see what’s happening on your network at a microscopic level.
- A network packet analyzer will try to capture network packets and tries to display that packet data as detailed as possible.

## How Wireshark works?

- Wireshark leverages **libpcap** on unix platforms and  **WinPcap** on Windows. This library provides an API to capture         packets.
